## Picking this up on another machine

Everything needed to build is committed. Two things are not, because they are
fetched rather than authored, and `data/cache/` is gitignored.

```powershell
# 1. vcpkg, if this machine does not have it. A FULL clone -- not --depth 1,
#    because vcpkg needs history to resolve versions.
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git $env:USERPROFILE\vcpkg
& $env:USERPROFILE\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

# 2. Build. The first configure builds the dependency tree from source and
#    takes a while; later ones are cached.
./scripts/dev-env.ps1 cmake --preset release
./scripts/dev-env.ps1 cmake --build --preset release
./scripts/dev-env.ps1 ctest --preset release          # 327 tests

# 3. The index membership history. This one still works.
python scripts/fetch_sp500.py
marketscan.exe --headless --build-universe data/cache/universe/sp500_history.csv

# 4. Price data. This one does NOT work -- see the blocker below.
python scripts/fetch_stooq.py --symbols AAPL

# 5. The research layer. Pure Python, no vcpkg, no MSVC, no engine.
pip install -r research/requirements.txt
pytest
```

Nothing else is machine-specific. The tests do not touch the network and the
committed fixtures are synthetic.

The research layer is worth knowing about separately: it needs none of the C++
toolchain. On a machine with Python and no vcpkg -- which is a normal state for
a machine that has only ever run the analysis -- `pytest` and
`python -m research.sweep` both work from a fresh clone.

## What exists

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| **Engine** | one event loop, templated on its clock | `EngineT<SimulatedClock>` and `EngineT<SystemClock>` both compiled and both run |
| **Money** | `int64` micro-dollars | the ledger identity holds exactly, not to a tolerance |
| **Plugin ABI** | pure C, frozen at v1 | loader branches on declared version; a v1 plugin survives a v2 host |
| **Execution** | spread-crossing by default, optional latency and partial fills | [`EXECUTION.md`](EXECUTION.md) |
| **Data** | daily bars, binary cache, one merged feed | [`DATA.md`](DATA.md) |
| **Identity** | `SecurityId`, dated resolution, dateless overload deleted | [`IDENTITY.md`](IDENTITY.md) |
| **Universe** | structural survivorship guard | a strategy has no API that returns a non-member |
| **GUI** | twelve panels, ImGui + ImPlot | `docs/screenshots/dashboard.png` |
| **Python** | pybind11 over the same `run_backtest` | `bindings/python/examples/quickstart.ipynb` |
| **Research** | synthetic panels, purged CV, constrained portfolios | [`research/README.md`](../research/README.md) |
| **Calibration** | the pipeline recovers a planted signal, is fooled by injected biases, and has a measured false-discovery rate | [`PATHOLOGIES.md`](PATHOLOGIES.md), [`FALSE_DISCOVERY.md`](FALSE_DISCOVERY.md) |

Milestones M0–M9 of Spec 1, and M0–M8 of Spec 2, are done. Specs are in
[`specs/`](specs/).

**327 C++ tests** on `debug`, `release`, `ci`, `ci-debug`; **328** on `full`.
**139 Python tests** in `research/tests`, run by the `research` CI job on
Linux -- deliberately, because the research layer depends on nothing in the C++
toolchain and the first import that changes that turns the job red.

## What Session B measured

The three numbers the research harness exists to produce. All of them are
statements about this pipeline on synthetic data; none of them says anything
about markets.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| **Recovery** | 18 runs across six values of λ, every one within two standard errors of the truth | [`figures/lambda_recovery.png`](figures/lambda_recovery.png) |
| **Pathologies** | survivorship 1.32× on the premium and +4.8%/yr on the index level; a lookahead R² of 0.66 against an honest 0.0002; a naive delisting policy removing 82% of the average loss | [`PATHOLOGIES.md`](PATHOLOGIES.md) |
| **False discovery** | **a Sharpe of 1.96** is the bar a result from a 252-variant search over three years has to clear to be distinguishable from noise | [`FALSE_DISCOVERY.md`](FALSE_DISCOVERY.md) |

Three of these changed after the first run produced something unexpected, and
the unexpected thing was right each time:

1. **Survivorship bias deflated the premium** in the first configuration. Not a
   bug: the failures were in the strategy's *short* leg, so removing them
   removed gains. The sign of survivorship bias follows which leg failed. Only
   the index-level inflation has a fixed sign, and the report says so instead of
   reporting the expected answer.
2. **The null panel was not null.** Its departure hazard was tilted by the
   exposure, which makes the exposure predict returns through the delisting
   channel — measurably, across seeds. A false-discovery rate measured on that
   would have been inflated by a signal that was genuinely there. The first
   40-minute sweep was discarded and re-run untilted; a test and its control
   pin it now.
3. **The best-of-N percentiles were not estimable** by resampling: drawing 252
   variants from a panel holding 252 returns the panel maximum every time, so
   the "95th percentile" was the largest Sharpe in the sweep. The threshold is
   now built from the per-variant distribution (1512 runs, near-normal) with the
   effective number of independent tries calibrated from the observed mean best
   — 252 correlated variants behave like 81 independent ones.

### One finding that is a live problem

**The information coefficient's t-statistic is not calibrated, and it fails in
the flattering direction.** On data containing no signal it rejects at 16.6%
against a nominal 5%, and the rate rises with the horizon: 8.9% at one period,
17.3% at five, 23.6% at twenty. `PipelineResult.ic_t` corrects for overlapping
labels with a Newey-West standard error at h−1 lags, and at twenty lags that
correction is itself too noisy to do the job.

The Sharpe (4.4%) and the Fama-MacBeth λ (5.6%) are both calibrated, so the
milestone's own results stand. But the IC is used for screening throughout
`research/`, and until this is fixed it is a descriptive statistic only. Fixing
it properly probably means a different long-run variance estimator, and it wants
its own measurement rather than a guess.

## Blocked — needs a decision

### 1. Stooq is gated, so identity cannot be measured

As of 2026-09-17 Stooq answers every request to its free CSV endpoint with
**HTTP 200 and a JavaScript browser-verification page**. Nothing here attempts
to defeat that check.

The consequence is narrow but real: the M3b identity classifier is built,
tested and calibrated, and has **nothing to point at**. All 53 membership gaps
read `unresolved: no price data`, so the 730-day threshold still governs and all
**41 splits remain inferences**.

Everything else works without it. The cache format, the feed, the universe, the
guard and the classifier are all exercised against committed synthetic fixtures.

**The options, none of which should be picked without deciding:**

| | |
|---|---|
| Wait | The gate may be temporary. Costs nothing, resolves nothing. |
| Another free source | Every one comes with a key, an account, or terms nobody here has read. Spec 1 forbids keys and accounts; Spec 2 named Stooq specifically. **This is a spec change, not a fix.** |
| A licensed source | CRSP deletes this problem entirely — PERMNO *is* the identity, and the whole inference heuristic gets deleted rather than adapted. |
| Ship without it | Legitimate. The splits stay inferences, the report says so, and the safe direction protects you. |

### 2. Forty-one identity splits want a human

`docs/IDENTITY_DECISIONS.md` has the table. Roughly a quarter are probably
wrong in the `keep` direction — continuously-listed companies that merely left
the index. Four obvious ones are already overridden (`AMD`, `CIEN`, `FSLR`,
`FMC`).

Corrections go in `data/security_overrides.csv`, one line each, then re-run
`--build-universe`. **Note:** if measurement ever becomes possible, that file is
regenerated from measurements and hand-written rows are overwritten — keep
durable corrections somewhere else and merge.

### 3. One unidentified transient test failure

A single `full`-preset run failed one test; three subsequent runs were clean and
the failing test was not captured. Not reproduced, not diagnosed. If it recurs,
grab the name — an intermittent failure nobody can name is worse than one that
fails every time.

---

## Next

**Session C — Spec 2 M9, parity and integration.** Read
`specs/BUILD_SPEC_2.md` §8 first.

1. **The parity test.** One trivial strategy — long the top decile of the
   synthetic exposure, short the bottom, monthly rebalance — implemented
   *twice*: once in the Python pipeline and once as a C++ theory using
   `CrossSectionalStrategy`. Same panel, both ways. Under optimistic fills and
   zero costs the equity curves must match to floating-point tolerance; under
   spread-crossing fills the C++ result must be worse by an amount consistent
   with the modelled costs. If they disagree, one of them is wrong, and finding
   out is the whole milestone.

   The panel to run it on comes out of `python -m research.export`, which writes
   bars and a membership history in the formats the engine already reads —
   `scripts/csv_to_msb.py` converts the bars, and the round trip is exercised by
   `research/tests/test_export.py` and by CI. What has **not** happened is an
   actual replay: no C++ binary has read those files, because the machine this
   session ran on has no vcpkg. Expect the first run to find something.

2. **The Universe Inspector panel** — membership over time, current members,
   add/drop events, forced exits.

3. **Documentation.** `README.md` still describes the project as of Spec 1. It
   has one line about `research/` in the repository layout and nothing else: no
   quickstart for it, no mention of what it measured, and a milestone table that
   stops at Spec 1 M9. Spec 2 §8 puts that in this milestone, and the material
   to draw on is [`research/README.md`](../research/README.md).

**Then M9b** (`specs/SPEC_VIEW_MODES.md`, dual GUI presentation modes, not
started).

One thing to carry into it: the research layer's delisting handling and the
engine's are **not the same model**. The pipeline compounds a departing name's
final return, which is the real answer to what a holder experienced; the engine
force-liquidates at the last price, which is optimistic. On a panel with
departures the two will disagree, and the disagreement is not a bug in either —
it is the known limitation below, showing up where it was always going to. Run
the parity test on a panel with `delist_hazard=0` first, so that a real
discrepancy is not hidden behind an expected one.

---

## Known limitations, by name

Not bugs. Things this cannot do, written down so they are not rediscovered.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forced exits are optimistic** | The biggest one. A name leaving the index is liquidated at the last price; real delisting returns are frequently −30% or everything. This is where naive backtests hide their losses. |
| **Renames are not inferred** | From ticker-keyed data a rename is indistinguishable from one name leaving and another arriving. `add_ticker` declares one; nothing populates it. |
| **No corporate actions** | No spin-offs, mergers, rights issues or share classes. |
| **No point-in-time restatements** | Prices are as they are today, adjustments included. |
| **Terminal order status** | A cancel, rejection or expiry produces no fill, so nothing tells the plugin the order is dead. Needs ABI v2; deliberately deferred. |
| **Free data is not research-grade** | Every number from it is a statement about this pipeline, not about markets. |
| **The research layer is frictionless** | No commission, no spread, no slippage — the engine owns execution, and a second cost model here would be a second answer to a question that already has one. Every Sharpe in `research/` reads better than anything tradeable. |
| **The null is Gaussian** | The false-discovery threshold was measured against a market factor plus normal noise. Real returns have fat tails, volatility clustering and cross-sectional structure that panel does not contain, all of which give a search more to find. The measured threshold is a floor. |
| **No research result is a market claim** | Every panel is synthetic and every λ was planted. Nothing in `research/` says anything about markets, and it is not built to. |
| **The IC t-statistic is not calibrated** | Rejects at 16.6% on data with no signal, rising to 23.6% at a twenty-period horizon. Measured, not suspected — see above. Use it descriptively; use the Sharpe or λ for inference. |

## The two properties everything rests on

Worth re-reading before changing anything structural.

> **A strategy cannot tell whether it is being backtested, paper traded, or
> trading live.** One engine, one ledger, one fill simulator. Only the clock and
> the transport swap. If you find yourself writing a second code path for
> "backtest mode", go back.

> **`theories/` is a USB port.** A compiled plugin dropped in is discovered at
> runtime, given its own virtual account, and appears in the GUI — with no host
> recompile and no host code that knows it exists.
